This repository has files for implementing 3 games.
The snake and paddle files use - turtle (that is freely available with the python package)
The tictactoe file uses - tkinter package (tk). You will need to install this on your machine

The paddle file is not quite correct and needs to be corrected. 

But first download this repo and then create your own on your github page. This will be good practice for other endeavors.
